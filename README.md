# **What To-Do - Web App**

## Overview
Being a student comes with a lot of responsibilities and tasks to complete. Along with being a student we also have every day life to live and things to do for that whether it is for work, personal errands, etc. My goal is to build a simple and effective to-do list web application. I want to build a software that incorporates everything needed for a planner type application of good quality. I also want to use this project as an opportunity to expand my front-end skills and work with more front-end languages and tools.
